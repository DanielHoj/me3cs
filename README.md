## What is it? <a name="What_is_it"></a>
*me3cs* is a framework for doing chemometrical data analysis in python. The main focus is to provide a pipeline, which can enhance the workflow when dealing with spectroscopical data.


## Why use it? <a name="why_use_it"></a>
* A high level, centralised workframe, enabling a fast and iterative analysis workflow. 
* A preprocessing module, including scaling, filtering, normalisation and standarisation methods.
* A missing values module, with different imputation and interpolation algorithms, and a quickway of removing `NaN` values.
* Machine learning models for different use-cases; regression, classification or exploratory analysis.
* Built in cross-validation methods, such as venetian blinds or contiguous blocks.
* Outlier detection methods, and quick removal of observational or variabel outliers.
* All algorithms are written with numpy or scipy, avoiding major dependencies.
